## Notes

If you deal with `static` functions, you better copy/paste them in the Proxy instead of making a trampoline of them because it won't work properly.  
Then after that, each function that call this `static` function should be redefined in a trampoline.  

I'm not sure yet but it seems that sometimes with Discord (and even without) opened it would crash with typing from in-game `rcon map_restart 0` / `rcon map mp/ffa2` (any map) with one of the following hook/trampoline:  

- `SV_PacketEvent`
- `SV_ConnectionlessPacket`
- `SVC_RemoteCommand`
